    <h1>Salmon</h1>
    <img src="../img/salmon.webp" alt="salmon" width="600">

    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Broiled salmon is incredibly moist and tender and perfect for a weeknight meal. The cooking time will depend on the thickness of the salmon; I suggest checking for doneness after 10 minutes. </p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup and ½ tablespoon and ½ teaspoon maple syrup, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce (such as Bragg®)</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>3 (6 ounce) skin-on center-cut salmon fillets</li>
        <li>⅜ teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>1 ½ serving cooking spray</li>
        <li>3 slices fresh pineapple, halved</li>
        <li>3 wedges lemon</li>

    </ul>

    <h1>Instructions</h1>

    <ol>
        
        <li>Combine 2 tablespoons maple syrup, soy sauce, lemon juice, and ginger in a bowl. Place salmon into the marinade and turn to coat. Marinate for at least 15 minutes, but no longer than 30.</li>
        
        <li>
            For the glaze, mix remaining 2 tablespoons maple syrup and Cajun seasoning together in a bowl. Set aside until ready to use.
        </li>
        
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler to low.</li>
        
        <li>Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and lightly spray with cooking spray. Remove the salmon from the marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Place salmon, skin side-down, and pineapple, onto the sheet and brush with the glaze.</li>
        
        <li>Broil in the preheated oven until salmon easily flakes with a fork and reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (62 degrees C), 13 to 15 minutes.</li>
        

    </ol>
